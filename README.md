For working with Docker: 

"docker compose up" to run
"docker compose up --build" to run (after you change code)

You can copy these into your .env (not a security issue Docker makes images on the spot so we can make up some values):

DB_USER=user1
DB_PASSWORD=12345
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=54321
DB_DATABASE=web_app
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
APP_PORT=5050
